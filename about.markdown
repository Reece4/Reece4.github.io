Hello!

As of December 2022 I am a student studying cyber security and networks at Glasgow Caledonian University. This is my personal blog site with the primary purpose to document my journey through cybersecurity. The main aim will be to post CTF write-ups and to write about anything else that I get up to in the world of cyber. I hope you find this site useful, or at least a little entertaining!
